# Competitive Programming C++ Template

This repository contains my personal C++ template for competitive programming contests, including Codeforces, AtCoder, and LeetCode-style problems.

## âœ¨ Features
- Fast I/O setup (`ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`)
- `int` aliased to `long long` for overflow safety
- Modular `solve()` function for clean logic
- Handy macros for STL and loops
- Compatible with Codeforces Div 2 and Div 3 rounds

## ðŸ“œ Rule Compliance
This template was written and published **before any contest**. It does not contain any third-party code that violates copyright or licensing rules.  
It is publicly available and timestamped via GitHub for transparency, in accordance with [Codeforces rules on third-party code](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/18426).

## ðŸ›  Usage
Clone or copy this template before a contest. Modify the `solve()` function to implement your solution logic.

## ðŸ“š License
